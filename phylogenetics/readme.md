# Phylogenetics Data Files

This directory contains all files and scripts used to generate the phylogenetic tree.

bfly.tree.R 			-- R Script to manually build the phylogenetic tree used for phylogenetic signal
bfly.tree.nwk			-- Resulting phylogenetic tree for phylogenetic signal
polyommatini.fas.timetree.nwk 	-- Newick tree file resulting from the phylogenetic analysis of the Polyommatini Tribe
eumaeini.fas.timetree.nwk 	-- Newick tree file resulting from the phylogenetic analysis of the Eumaeini Tribe
polyommatini.fas		-- Alignment file of all Polyommatini sequences and A. mormo consensus (outgroup) used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction
eumaeini.fas			-- Alignment file of all Eumaeini sequences and A. mormo consensus (outgroup) used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction
a_mormo.fasta			-- Alignment file of all A. mormo sequences used to create a consensus file to use as the outgroup for phylogenetic tree reconstructions

Note: All sequences in the alignments have retained their GenBank FASTA headers. Refer to the headers for the GenBank IDs.
The only exception is C. niphon, which has the GenBank ID: KP150297.1
